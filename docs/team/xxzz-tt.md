## Project: Recretary

Recretary is a desktop app for managing contacts and meetings, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). For fast typists, Recretary is the faster option for finishing contact and meeting management tasks than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add and edit a meeting.
  * What it does: allows the user to add a meeting with a title, date, duration and location and update it later.
  * Justification: These commands are among the basic requirements of the app. 
  
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add and delete a participant in the meeting.
  * What it does: allows the user to add or delete one of the contacts in a meeting's participant's list.
  * Justification: These commands form the basic features of a meeting object.
