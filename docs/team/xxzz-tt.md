## Project: Recretary

Recretary is a desktop app for managing contacts and meetings, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). For fast typists, Recretary is the faster option for finishing contact management tasks than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add and edit a meeting.
  * What it does: allows the user to add a meeting with a title, date, duration and location and update it later.
  * Justification: These commands are among the basic requirements of the app. 
  
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add and delete a participant in the meeting.
  * What it does: allows the user to add or delete one of the contacts in a meeting's participant's list.
  * Justification: These commands form the basic features of a meeting object.
