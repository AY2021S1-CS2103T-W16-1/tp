## Project: Recretary

Recretary is a desktop app for managing contacts and meetings, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). For fast typists, Recretary is the faster option for finishing contact management tasks than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to export all meetings as a .ics file.
* What it does: allows the user to export meetings as an iCalendar file, compatible with other calendar apps.
* Justification: This feature improves the product because a user can retrieve all their meetings to share easily with other non-Recretary users.

* **New Feature**: Implemented the Meeting class and functional classes for meetings to pave the way to add meeting commands.
* What it does: contains classes for meetings and all attributes of a meeting, handles conversion of meeting and attributes to json, and tests each of the added methods.
* Justification: This feature improves the product because it lays the foundation for all future implementation of our main features.
* Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth knowledge of the structure of the base code.
* Credits: The code was adapted from the pre-existing base code structure of Person class and functional classes for contacts.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=ramenmen&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=ramenmen&tabRepo=AY2021S1-CS2103T-W16-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code)

* **Project management**:
  * Managed release `v1.2` on GitHub

(below this is undone)
* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Updated the GUI color scheme (Pull requests [\#33](), [\#34]())
  * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 88% to 92% (Pull requests [\#36](), [\#38]())

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the features `delete` and `find` [\#72]()
    * Did cosmetic tweaks to existing documentation of features `clear`, `exit`: [\#74]()
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added implementation details of the `delete` feature.

* **Community**:
  * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): [\#12](), [\#32](), [\#19](), [\#42]()
  * Contributed to forum discussions (examples: [1](), [2](), [3](), [4]())
  * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](), [2](), [3]())
  * Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates ([1](), [2]())

* **Tools**:
  * Integrated a third party library (Natty) to the project ([\#42]())
  * Integrated a new Github plugin (CircleCI) to the team repo

* _{you can add/remove categories in the list above}_
