## Project: Recretary

Recretary is a desktop app for managing contacts and meetings, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). For fast typists, Recretary is the faster option for finishing contact management tasks than traditional GUI apps.

## Contributions to the project

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=ramenmen&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=ramenmen&tabRepo=AY2021S1-CS2103T-W16-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code)

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to export all meetings as a .ics file.
* What it does: allows the user to export meetings as an iCalendar file, compatible with other calendar apps.
* Justification: This feature improves the product because a user can retrieve all their meetings to share easily with other non-Recretary users.

* **New Feature**: Implemented the Meeting class and functional classes for meetings to pave the way to add meeting commands.
* What it does: contains classes for meetings and all attributes of a meeting, handles conversion of meeting and attributes to and from json, and tests each of the added methods and classes.
* Justification: This feature improves the product because it lays the foundation for all future implementation of our main features.
* Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth knowledge of the structure of the base code.
* Credits: Part of the code was adapted from the pre-existing base code structure of Person class and functional classes for contacts.

* **Project management**:
  * Managed release `v1.2` on GitHub
